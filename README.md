Just a short summary about my project,

Enhanced Calculator:
In this project, I have improved upon a basic calculator application by adding more features and functionality. The calculator supports standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as scientific functions (square root, exponentiation, trigonometric calculations). I ensured a user-friendly interface with input validation and proper error handling (e.g., division by zero). Additionally, I implemented memory functions to store and recall values. Overall, the enhanced calculator provides a richer set of capabilities compared to a simple calculator.

Contact Management System:
For the contact management system, I had designed a solution to organize and manage contact information. Users can add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, email, and address. The system allows searching for contacts by name or other criteria, editing existing entries, and deleting contacts. Contacts can be sorted alphabetically or based on other attributes. I also ensured persistent storage of contact data, possibly using a database or file storage. The contact management system streamlines the process of maintaining and accessing contact information efficiently.

Through these projects, I honed your Java programming skills, including working with data structures, control structures, and object-oriented concepts. These practical applications demonstrate your ability to create useful software solutions using Java. Itâ€™s a great starting point for building more complex applications in the future!
